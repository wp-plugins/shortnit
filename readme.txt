Shortn.It is a customizable, self-hosted, URL shortener for WordPress.

== Description ==

= It's like having your own custom bit.ly service =

You've probably seen major corporations with short URLs utilizing a domain that's shorter than their main domain, but still reflects their brand. Shortn.It allows you to achieve the same effect with your brand, no matter how large or small. All you need is Shortn.It, WordPress (2.5+), and if you want, a short domain configured as an alias. If you're not sure how to configure an alias domain, a guide can be found in the <a href="http://docof.me/shortn-it">help and documentation</a>.

Shortn.It is a customizable, URL shortener that allows you to create shortened, unique, permalinks to any and every post imaginable. **If you can post it, you can create a short link for it.** Shortn.It automatically creates a short URL using a combination of lowercase, uppercase, and numeric characters (depending on the options you've set), but can be customized to be whatever URL safe string you wish.

Shortn.It adds the appropriate tags for <a href="//sites.google.com/a/snaplog.com/wiki/short_url" title="read more about shorturl">shorturl auto discovery</a> and <a href="//microformats.org/wiki/rel-shortlink" title="Read more about shortlink">rel="shortlink"</a> as desired.

Shortn.It provides easy functions for accessing it's generated URLs outside of Shortn.It, in your themes, or other plugins. The `the_full_shortn_url` will output just the full URL, without any formatting, which can be used in various Twitter or other microblogging plugins. `the_shortn_url_link` will output an HTML link using the configuration from Shortn.It's options page.
